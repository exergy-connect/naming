anomaly:
  - anomaly_id: "mercury-perihelion-precession"
    name: "Mercury's Perihelion Precession"
    description: |
      The observed precession of Mercury's perihelion (the point of closest approach to the Sun)
      was approximately 43 arcseconds per century more than could be explained by Newtonian
      mechanics, even accounting for perturbations from other planets. This anomaly challenged
      Newton's theory of gravitation and was one of the key pieces of evidence that led to
      the development of general relativity.

  - anomaly_id: "ultraviolet-catastrophe"
    name: "Ultraviolet Catastrophe"
    description: |
      Classical statistical mechanics predicted that a blackbody should emit infinite energy
      at high frequencies (ultraviolet and beyond), which contradicted experimental observations.
      This anomaly showed that classical physics could not explain blackbody radiation and
      led to the development of quantum mechanics.

  - anomaly_id: "michelson-morley-null-result"
    name: "Michelson-Morley Null Result"
    description: |
      The Michelson-Morley experiment attempted to detect the motion of Earth through the
      hypothetical luminiferous ether by measuring the speed of light in different directions.
      The experiment found no difference in the speed of light regardless of direction,
      contradicting the ether theory and leading to the development of special relativity.

        violation_description: "Classical mechanics assumes time is absolute, but the Michelson-Morley experiment's null result showed that the speed of light is constant in all directions, contradicting the assumption of absolute time and space"

  - anomaly_id: "pioneer-anomaly"
    name: "Pioneer Anomaly"
    description: |
      The Pioneer 10 and Pioneer 11 spacecraft exhibited an unexplained constant acceleration
      towards the Sun of approximately 8.74 × 10⁻¹⁰ m/s². This anomalous acceleration was
      observed over decades of tracking data and could not be explained by known forces,
      including solar radiation pressure, general relativity effects, or spacecraft systematics.
      The anomaly challenged our understanding of gravity in the outer solar system.
    theory_id: "general-relativity"
    discovery_year: 1998
    explanation: |
      Year: 2012. The anomaly was largely resolved through detailed analysis showing that
      anisotropic thermal radiation from the spacecraft's radioisotope thermoelectric generators
      and electrical systems provided the missing acceleration. However, some residual
      unexplained acceleration may still exist, suggesting possible new physics or incomplete
      understanding of thermal effects.

        assumption_id: "gr-assumption-1"
        violation_description: "General relativity assumes that all accelerations can be explained by spacetime curvature and known forces, but the Pioneer anomaly suggested an unexplained acceleration that might indicate new physics or incomplete understanding of gravity at large distances"

  - anomaly_id: "hubble-tension"
    name: "Hubble Tension"
    description: |
      A significant discrepancy between measurements of the Hubble constant (H₀) from early
      universe observations (cosmic microwave background, CMB) and late universe observations
      (Type Ia supernovae, Cepheid variables). Early universe measurements suggest H₀ ≈ 67 km/s/Mpc,
      while late universe measurements suggest H₀ ≈ 73 km/s/Mpc. This ~5-10% tension challenges
      the standard ΛCDM cosmological model and suggests possible new physics or systematic errors.
    theory_id: "flrw-metric"

    violated_assumptions:
      - violated_assumption_id: "hubble-tension-violated-assumption-1"
        assumption_id: "flrw-assumption-1"
        violation_description: "The FLRW metric assumes a homogeneous and isotropic universe, but the Hubble tension suggests possible spatial variations, evolution of dark energy, or new physics that breaks the cosmological principle"

  - anomaly_id: "cosmic-blueshift"
    name: "Cosmic Blueshift Anomaly"
    description: |
      While most distant galaxies show redshift due to cosmic expansion (Hubble's law),
      some observations have reported unexpected blueshifts or anomalous redshift patterns
      that cannot be explained by simple Hubble flow. These include local blueshifts in
      certain galaxy clusters, anomalous redshift quantization, and discrepancies between
      predicted and observed redshifts. This challenges the assumption of uniform cosmic
      expansion and the FLRW cosmological model.
    theory_id: "flrw-metric"
    discovery_year: 1976
    explanation: |
      Most blueshift observations are explained by local peculiar velocities (galaxies moving
      within clusters) rather than cosmic expansion. However, some anomalous redshift patterns
      remain unexplained and may indicate large-scale structure effects, modified gravity,
      or systematic measurement errors. The redshift quantization claims remain controversial
      and unverified by mainstream cosmology.

        assumption_id: "flrw-assumption-1"
        violation_description: "The FLRW metric assumes uniform cosmic expansion, but blueshift observations and anomalous redshift patterns suggest possible local deviations, large-scale structure effects, or violations of the cosmological principle"
