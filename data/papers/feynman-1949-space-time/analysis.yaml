    verification_year: 1949

  - claim_id: "qed-claim-4"
    theory_id: "quantum-electrodynamics"
    statement: "The space-time view makes relativistic invariance self-evident, in contrast to the Hamiltonian method which obscures it"
    status: "verified"
    verification_year: 1949

  - claim_id: "qed-claim-5"
    theory_id: "quantum-electrodynamics"
    statement: "Each term in the expansion in powers of e²/ℏc can be written down and understood directly from a physical point of view"
    status: "verified"
    verification_year: 1949

  - claim_id: "ren-claim-2"
    theory_id: "renormalization"
    statement: "By modifying the interaction of electrons at short distances, all matrix elements become finite except those relating to vacuum polarization"
    status: "verified"
    verification_year: 1949

  - claim_id: "ren-claim-3"
    theory_id: "renormalization"
    statement: "The only effects sensitive to the modification are changes in mass and charge of electrons, which cannot be directly observed"
    status: "verified"
    verification_year: 1949

  - claim_id: "ren-claim-4"
    theory_id: "renormalization"
    statement: "Phenomena directly observable are insensitive to the details of the modification used (except at extreme energies), allowing a limit to be taken as the range of modification goes to zero"
    status: "verified"
    verification_year: 1949

  - claim_id: "fd-claim-2"
    theory_id: "feynman-diagrams"
    statement: "The simplification results from combining processes that were previously unnecessarily separated, such as processes involving virtual pairs with those involving only positive energy electrons"
    status: "verified"
    verification_year: 1949

  - claim_id: "fd-claim-3"
    theory_id: "feynman-diagrams"
    statement: "The space-time approach permits matrix elements to be written down directly for any specific problem without requiring the complicated machinery of Hamiltonian electrodynamics"
    status: "verified"
    verification_year: 1949

postulate:
  - postulate_id: "qed-postulate-2"
    theory_id: "quantum-electrodynamics"
    statement: "Electrodynamics can be described as a direct interaction at a distance (albeit delayed in time) between charges, rather than through field oscillators"
    formulation_year: 1949

  - postulate_id: "qed-postulate-3"
    theory_id: "quantum-electrodynamics"
    statement: "The interaction viewpoint is best for virtual quanta, while the field viewpoint is best for real quanta"
    formulation_year: 1949

assumption:
  - assumption_id: "qed-assumption-3"
    theory_id: "quantum-electrodynamics"
    statement: "The interaction between charges can be modified at short distances to make divergent integrals finite"
    rationale: "This modification allows systematic removal of infinities through renormalization"

  - assumption_id: "qed-assumption-4"
    theory_id: "quantum-electrodynamics"
    statement: "Observable phenomena are insensitive to the details of the short-distance modification (except at extreme energies)"
    rationale: "This allows taking the limit as the cut-off goes to zero for observable processes"
