    summary: |
      Riemann's foundational work introducing n-dimensional manifolds, metric tensors, and intrinsic curvature.
      This paper established that space is a particular case of a triply extended magnitude, that geometry
      cannot be derived from general notions of magnitude alone, and that the properties distinguishing
      space must be deduced from experience. It introduced the concept of manifolds, measure-relations,
      and curvature, laying the groundwork for differential geometry and later general relativity.

assumption:
  - assumption_id: "riemann-assumption-manifold"
    theory_id: "riemannian-geometry"
    statement: "Space can be described as a multiply extended magnitude (manifold) of n dimensions"
    rationale: "Riemann constructs the notion of a multiply extended magnitude from general notions of magnitude, establishing that space is a particular case of a triply extended magnitude"

  - assumption_id: "riemann-assumption-line-length"
    theory_id: "riemannian-geometry"
    statement: "The length of lines is independent of their position, and consequently every line is measurable by means of every other"
    rationale: "This is the hypothesis that first presents itself for measure-determinations, allowing the establishment of a mathematical expression for the length of a line"

  - assumption_id: "riemann-assumption-quadric"
    theory_id: "riemannian-geometry"
    statement: "The line-element is expressible as the square root of a quadric differential expression (flatness in the smallest parts)"
    rationale: "Riemann restricts himself to manifoldnesses where the line element is expressed as the square root of a quadric differential, which includes the simplest cases and allows geometric representation"

  - assumption_id: "riemann-assumption-experience"
    theory_id: "riemannian-geometry"
    statement: "The properties which distinguish space from other conceivable triply extended magnitudes are only to be deduced from experience"
    rationale: "Riemann argues that geometry cannot be derived from general notions of magnitude alone, and that the measure-relations of space must be determined from empirical facts, which are hypotheses of empirical certainty"

postulate:
  - postulate_id: "riemann-postulate-manifold-construction"
    theory_id: "riemannian-geometry"
    statement: "A multiply extended magnitude is constructed by composing a variability of m+1 dimensions out of a variability of n dimensions and a variability of one dimension"
    formulation_year: 1854

  - postulate_id: "riemann-postulate-position-reduction"
    theory_id: "riemannian-geometry"
    statement: "The determination of position in an n-ply extended manifoldness is reduced to n determinations of quantity"
    formulation_year: 1854

  - postulate_id: "riemann-postulate-line-element"
    theory_id: "riemannian-geometry"
    statement: "The linear element ds is the square root of an always positive integral homogeneous function of the second order of the quantities dx, in which the coefficients are continuous functions of the quantities x"
    formulation_year: 1854

  - postulate_id: "riemann-postulate-curvature"
    theory_id: "riemannian-geometry"
    statement: "The measure-relations of a manifoldness are determined by the curvature at each point in ½n(n-1) surface-directions"
    formulation_year: 1854

  - claim_id: "riemann-claim-space-particular"
    theory_id: "riemannian-geometry"
    statement: "Space is only a particular case of a triply extended magnitude, and a multiply extended magnitude is capable of different measure-relations"

    theory_id: "riemannian-geometry"

    theory_id: "riemannian-geometry"
    statement: "Manifoldnesses in which the square of the line-element may be expressed as the sum of the squares of complete differentials are called flat (Euclidean space is a special case)"
    status: "verified"

  - claim_id: "riemann-claim-curvature-measure"
    theory_id: "riemannian-geometry"
    statement: "The curvature at a point in a given surface-direction measures the deviation of the manifoldness from flatness at that point"
    status: "verified"

  - claim_id: "riemann-claim-constant-curvature"
    theory_id: "riemannian-geometry"
    statement: "Manifoldnesses with constant curvature allow figures to be moved without stretching, and the measure-relations depend only on the value of the curvature"
    status: "verified"

  - claim_id: "riemann-claim-space-unbounded"
    theory_id: "riemannian-geometry"
    statement: "Space is an unbounded three-fold manifoldness, but its infinite extent does not follow from this; if space has constant positive curvature, it must necessarily be finite"
    status: "verified"

  - claim_id: "riemann-claim-triangle-sum"
    theory_id: "riemannian-geometry"
    statement: "If the curvature at each point is zero in three surface-directions, the sum of the angles of a triangle is always equal to two right angles (Euclidean geometry)"
    status: "verified"

prediction:
  - prediction_id: "riemann-prediction-astronomical-curvature"
    theory_id: "riemannian-geometry"
    statement: "If bodies exist independently of position, the curvature is everywhere constant, and astronomical measurements should determine that it cannot be different from zero, or its reciprocal must be an area in comparison with which the range of our telescopes may be neglected"
    prediction_year: 1854
    status: "verified"
    verification_year: 1919
    verification_method: "Eddington expedition confirmed that space is approximately flat on large scales, though general relativity later showed local curvature near massive objects"

  - prediction_id: "riemann-prediction-infinitesimal-geometry"
    theory_id: "riemannian-geometry"
    statement: "The metric relations of space in the infinitely small may not conform to the hypotheses of geometry, and we ought to suppose this if we can thereby obtain a simpler explanation of phenomena"
    prediction_year: 1854
    status: "verified"
    verification_year: 1915
    verification_method: "Einstein showed that spacetime curvature explains gravitational phenomena, validating Riemann's insight that geometry in the small may differ from Euclidean geometry"

  - prediction_id: "riemann-prediction-discrete-manifold"
    theory_id: "riemannian-geometry"
    statement: "Either the reality which underlies space must form a discrete manifoldness, or we must seek the ground of its metric relations outside it, in binding forces which act upon it"
    prediction_year: 1854
    status: "partially_verified"
    verification_year: 1915
    verification_method: "Einstein's general relativity showed that metric relations come from the stress-energy tensor (binding forces), partially validating the second option"
