# Relational Quantum Mechanics Data
# This file represents Relational Quantum Mechanics theory proposed by Carlo Rovelli
# Created from session: a8eba5da-5965-4167-80bc-cc903018a424

theory:
  - theory_id: "relational-quantum-mechanics"
    name: "Relational Quantum Mechanics"
    year: 1996
    summary: "Interpretation of quantum mechanics that states quantum states are relative to observers, not absolute. Proposes that there is no absolute state of a system, only states relative to other systems. Resolves the measurement problem by eliminating the need for wave function collapse."

    papers:

    assumptions:
      - assumption_id: "rqm-assumption-1"
        statement: "Quantum states are relative to observers, not absolute"
        rationale: "There is no absolute state of a system; states only exist relative to other systems (observers)"
      - assumption_id: "rqm-assumption-2"
        statement: "All systems are equivalent as observers"
        rationale: "Any physical system can serve as an observer; there is no fundamental distinction between observer and observed"
    postulates:
      - postulate_id: "rqm-postulate-1"
        statement: "The state of a system is only defined relative to another system (observer)"

    claims:
      - claim_id: "rqm-claim-1"
        statement: "Relational Quantum Mechanics resolves the measurement problem without requiring wave function collapse"
        status: "theoretical"
