theory:
  - theory_id: "classical-mechanics"
    name: "Classical Mechanics"
    year: 1687
    summary: "Branch of physics that describes the motion of macroscopic objects under the influence of forces. Based on Newton's laws of motion and the assumption of absolute space and time."
    category: "Classical Mechanics"
    people:
      - "isaac-newton"
    assumptions:
      - assumption_id: "cm-assumption-1"
        statement: "Time is absolute and global - it flows uniformly and identically for all observers, regardless of their motion or position"
        rationale: "This fundamental assumption distinguishes classical mechanics from relativity, where time is relative. In classical mechanics, there is a universal 'now' that all observers share."
      - assumption_id: "cm-assumption-2"
        statement: "Space is absolute - it exists as a fixed, unchanging background independent of matter and energy"
        rationale: "Space is treated as a three-dimensional Euclidean space that provides the stage for physical events, but is not affected by them"
      - assumption_id: "cm-assumption-3"

        statement: "Newton's Second Law: The acceleration of an object is directly proportional to the net force acting on it and inversely proportional to its mass (F = ma)"
        formulation_year: 1687

            rationale: "Three-dimensional space follows Euclidean geometry and is independent of matter"
